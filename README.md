## What is this?

Everything between the socket and a decoded Bedrock packet. It is the transport layer of
[Falcon](https://github.com/Falcon-MC/Falcon) and builds on top of
[Protocol](https://github.com/Falcon-MC/Protocol).

- **RakNet** - own implementation of the peer, sockets, bit stream, reliability layer and connection
  handshake
- **NetherNet** - WebRTC transport through libdatachannel, with the signaling server and LAN
  discovery
- **Peers** - batching and compression layers stacked on top of the raw transport, behind a common
  `NetworkPeer` interface
- **Connection requests** - parsing of the client login JWT (identity, skin, device)
- **Server locator** - the pong data advertised to the server list

## Usage

The library is a plain CMake target named `FalconNetwork`. When it is built on its own, it fetches
Protocol and libdatachannel automatically:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    falcon_network
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Falcon-MC/Network.git
    GIT_TAG main
    GIT_SHALLOW TRUE
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(falcon_network)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FalconNetwork)
```

## Building

Requires CMake 3.16+, a C++17 compiler, zlib and OpenSSL. The first configure needs network access to
fetch the dependencies.

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```
